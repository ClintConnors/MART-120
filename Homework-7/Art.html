<h3 class="subHeaders">A Joke I Heard at a Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>Jimmy wants to ask Patricia, the girl of his dreams, to prom.  The trouble is, she’s the most popular girl in school, <br /> and all of the other boys are lined up to ask her out.  So, Jimmy gets in line, and he waits and waits and waits. <br />  After fifteen minutes, it’s his turn, and he asks Patricia to the dance.  She says, “Yes!”</p>
<p>Now, Jimmy has to go pick out a suit.  He finds the perfect outfit, but the line to the cash register is atrocious.  So, <br /> he hops in back, and he waits and waits and waits.  After thirty minutes, he’s finally able to make his purchase.</P>
<p>A week before the big night, Jimmy realizes that he forgot to get a ticket!  Unfortunately, half of the school forgot to <br /> get theirs too, and they’re crowding the ticket booth.  So, Jimmy gets in line, and he waits and waits and waits.  After <br /> an hour, he manages to snag the last available ticket.</p>
<p>Prom eventually rolls around, and it’s an absolute blast.  Jimmy and Patricia are having the time of their lives.  About <br /> halfway through, Patricia asks Jimmy if he would go get her some punch.  He agrees, but deep down, he’s disgusted. <br />  Everyone’s probably thirsty at this point in the night, and he’s going to have to get in line and wait and wait and wait. <br />  But when he reaches the concessions, he can’t believe it.  There’s no punch line. </p>
